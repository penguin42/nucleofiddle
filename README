Just me fiddling with an STM32F401 Nucleo board

Grab the stlink tools and then do:

./st-util -m

that starts a gdb server which you can then connect to:

[dg@major ~]$ arm-none-eabi-gdb 
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:4242

and then load the binary you built from this source:
(gdb) load /discs/more/nucleo/fiddle/fiddle
Loading section .text, size 0x170 lma 0x8000000
Start address 0x8000008, load size 368
Transfer rate: 396 bytes/sec, 368 bytes/write.

you can see the serial using a terminal connected to the /dev/ttyACM0
setup for 9k6 8n1
